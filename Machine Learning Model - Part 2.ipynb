    "- **XGBoost outperformed Random Forest** with identical settings.\n",
    "- **Deep models** like BERT performed worse than XGBoost, considering our specific use cases.\n",
    "- **Ensembles don’t always ensure better performance** on the test set.\n",
    "- **Feature extraction** is crucial for strong performance, regardless of the model choice.\n",
    "- **Sklearn, pandas, and PyTorch** are robust frameworks for machine learning.\n",
    "- **High-feature models** (with features almost 10% of sample size) performed well and were less prone to overfitting than expected.\n",
